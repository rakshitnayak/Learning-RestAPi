# Learning-RestAPi

Hey everyone , I made this app.js while learning RestAPI ..i learnt how to GET,PUT,POST,PATCH,DELETE the specific component in database!



To run this app.js you need to create mongodb database namely "wikidb",you must be familiar with crud operations.
-> in terminal run nodemon app.js
-> in localhost:3000/articles you can see your articles updated in mongoose database which is json format!
